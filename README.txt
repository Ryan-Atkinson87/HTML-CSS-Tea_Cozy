I created this web page as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course 
available at https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer.

The aim of this project is to write a web page using the flex box system.

I came back to Codecademy after a long break due to my Open University work.

I found this project helped remind me of how to write the HTML and CSS code.
